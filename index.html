    <h3 style="color: floralwhite";>we decided to do something adventurous, as we live in plains to decided to go uphill,<br>towards the mountain, after a lot of discussion, debates we decided to go for rafting,<br>we started searching for nearby rafting spot, after a lot of research we got to know about "RISHIKESH" a religious place. It is located around 330 km . <br>
        
    we put our destination on google maps and started our road trip. It was a roughly 8 hours ride taking halts at dhabas and restaurants.
    we reached Rishikesh around 5 pm. we decided to book a budget-friendly hotel. as we were late for rafting and tired of driving we planned to do rafting the next day. we decided to see famous tourist places like Lakshman jhula a well-known bridge on the river Ganga which is famous all around the globe. it is a marvelous bridge. and look awesome at night with wonderful lighting. we decided to camp on the bank of river Ganga. it was a wonderful night. weather was great with a cold breeze and the sound of the river flowing, moving leaves was like the cherry on the cake.

<h3 style="color: white"> Many people “aspire” to run Grade V, but in all honesty, Grade V and Grade III can be just as much fun. There is no need for previous experience to run any grade of river or rapid, as your guide team have run these rapids many times and will make expert judgements both on and off the river.

You will be one member of an excellent paddling team that allows you to challenge big whitewater safely, having faith not only in your guide, but in your team of fellow adventurers too. There are a variety of grades of rapid on each river, so even though there are some Grade V rapids on the Zambezi, there are also Grade II-IV rapids as well.<br>
