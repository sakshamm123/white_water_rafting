        <h1 style="color: floralwhite">How It Started</h1>
        <h3 style="color: floralwhite";"text-align :center">It all started when me and my friends <br>were playing BGMI and talking about past <br>, future as we have recently cleared +2 <br> but sadly from the online class, we created <br>memories we do not <br>meet very often. As the virus was <br>disappearing  and new normal was <br>replacing by a new normal or you can <br>say old normal so we decided to plan a <br>trip which can be remembered forever <br>before everyone creates a new normal</h3>

        <h1 style="color: floralwhite">Execution</h1>
    <h3 style="color: floralwhite">we decided to do something adventurous,<br> as we live in plains to decided to go uphill,<br>towards the mountain, after a lot of <br>discussion, debates we decided to go <br>for rafting,we started searching for nearby rafting <br>spot, after a lot of research we got to know about <br>"RISHIKESH" a religious place. It is located around <br> 330 km . <br>
        .<br>
    we put our destination on google maps and started <br>our road trip. It was a roughly 8 hours ride taking <br>halts at dhabas and restaurants.
    we reached Rishikesh around 5 pm. we decided to book a budget-friendly hotel. as we were late for rafting and tired of driving we planned to do rafting the next day. we decided to see famous tourist places like Lakshman jhula a well-known bridge on the river Ganga which is famous all around the globe. it is a marvelous bridge. and look awesome at night with wonderful lighting. we decided to camp on the bank of river Ganga. it was a wonderful night. weather was great with a cold breeze and the sound of the river flowing, moving leaves was like the cherry on the cake.

    <h3 style="color: floralwhite">
    <p>Finally the day arrived we were super excited for rafting .our excitement vanished all our tiredness , we booked a ride from rafting point .there were 4 more people with us . we gathered at marine drive which is 24 km away from rishikesh . we were provied with safety jackes as safety is utmost importants we were not allowed to take electronical items with us as there was chances of damage to the electrical items . we wlso submitted our expensive items . there was a training of approx 15 before rafting , in which we were taught how to use raft paddles . how to cntrol the speed of rafting boat . what should we do in case of emergency etc and etc.<br>now we were all ready for  rafting . i was little nervous after seeing thwe waves but excited at the same time . It was a thrilling experenice ,at some place river was quiet at some place it was aggresive , at some place i was about to fall but survived :) it was  around 5 hour stretch from marine drive to rishikesh covering a distance of 24 km falling in grade 2 and grade 3. it was extremely thrilling expereince.which should be experienced by each and every person once in a lifetime . With today technology it bacame safe and more thrilling. </p>
